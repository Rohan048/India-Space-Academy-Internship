# ISA Summer School 2025 – Project
**Title:** Predicting the Hubble Parameter and the Age of the Universe using Supernovae Ia Data
## 🔭 Overview
This project estimates the Hubble Constant (H₀) and the age of the universe using Type Ia Supernova data. It was part of the India Space Academy's Astronomy & Astrophysics Summer School 2025.

## 📌 Project Goals
- Use redshift and distance modulus data of Supernovae Ia
- Fit a model to estimate H₀
- Calculate the age of the universe assuming ΛCDM (Ωₘ = 0.3)
- Compare low-z vs high-z samples
- Analyze residuals and interpret cosmological implications

## 📊 Key Results
- **Estimated H₀:** 70.96 km/s/Mpc  
- **Age of Universe:** ~13.46 billion years  
- **H₀ Low-z vs High-z:** 70.96 vs 69.91 km/s/Mpc

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Cosmological model fitting
- Real data analysis using Python
- Basics of ΛCDM and Hubble tension

## 👨‍💻 Tools Used
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
